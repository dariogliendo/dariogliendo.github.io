At fist I worked doing mostly web design using WordPress and making some basic functionality with JavaScript mostly for marketing purposes.\nAfter a few years, I started growing apart from the marketing world and feeling closer to software development, and so I started digging deeper on JavaScript, frameworks, and finally backend development. Now, all in all I've been developing websites and software for several years and am eager to keep expanding my carreer further."
